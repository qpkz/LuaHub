This repository includes many lua scripts you can use on executors, ranging from basic to advanced.
Currently in the works

HttpService:GetAsync("https://github.com/qpkz/LuaHub/blob/main/exploit.lua/")

Replace exploit with the exploit you want (look at the files for the exploits), copy it, and paste it into your executor. If it does not work, then the game chosen did not enable HTTP Request.
